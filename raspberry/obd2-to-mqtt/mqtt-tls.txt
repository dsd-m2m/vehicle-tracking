This file contains the documentation with all the steps needed to activate TLS communication 
with MQTT broker

Important note: in creation of server.key I have eliminated the -des3 to avoid a passphrase

Steps:

First of all, I have created, using openssl, my own CA.
Therefore I have created key and cert for CA and key and cert for the broker, signed with CA key.

1. CA 
Generate keys and certificate for the Certification Authority
You're going to generate a self-signed certificate, contained in ca.crt file

openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -extensions v3_ca -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt


enerating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.+++
........................+++
writing new private key to 'ca.key'
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IT
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:IT
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Rome
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Saetta
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:CA
Email Address []:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1834 Dec 28 15:41 ca.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1233 Dec 28 15:41 ca.crt

The CA passphrase set is ....

2. generate key, pair for the broker

2.1 
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
...........+++
...................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

(eliminando -des3 non chiede la passkey per la server.key)

2.2 generate CSR
openssl req -out server.csr -key server.key -new

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IT
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:IT
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Rome
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Saetta
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: <my mqtt broker FQDN>

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:

ls -lrt

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1834 Dec 28 15:41 ca.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1233 Dec 28 15:41 ca.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1743 Dec 28 15:45 server.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1033 Dec 28 15:47 server.csr

3. Sign the certificate assigned to the broker using CA keys
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ./ca.crt -CAkey ./ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 730
Signature ok
subject=/C=IT/ST=IT/L=Rome/O=Saetta/CN=<my mqtt broker FQDN>
Getting CA Private Key
Enter pass phrase for ./ca.key:

The certificate is now in server.crt

4. Configuration to add to mosquitto broker mosquitto.conf

listener 8883
cafile /mosquitto/config/certs/ca.crt
certfile /mosquitto/config/certs/server.crt
keyfile /mosquitto/config/certss/server.key

5. Config file placement on containers environment

I have placed in /home/ubuntu/containers/mosquitto/certs

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1233 Dec 28 15:55 ca.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1188 Dec 28 15:55 server.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1743 Dec 28 15:55 server.key
